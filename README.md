### usage

configure the plugin with the deployment username, one or more hosts, and shell script to run on the hosts.

In the shell script input field you can use metadata information from the job document. For example to set environment variables on the remote server or hand over information to a script.

`./deploy.sh <%= ref.branch %>`

Have a look at the [metadata plugin](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-metadata) for all fields of the job document.

**Note on _Transfer bundle?_ flag**

Currently, "bundling" is provided by npmd-pack which turns a directory into a tarball for npm, this happens to work pretty nicely for any project, not just node.js projects. Anyway it is npmd-pack that is respecting the .gitignore file. You can see it being used in bundler.js line 12.

Simply remember that with _Transfer bundle?_ flag enable al files and folder listed in your `.gitignore` **will not be transfered**. Check [this](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-ssh-deploy/issues/17) issue for more information.
